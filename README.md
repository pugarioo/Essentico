# üìù TaskFlow: Simple Task Management App

## Project Overview

**TaskFlow** is a simple, responsive web-based task management application built entirely with **React Functional Components**. The application enables users to create, organize, and track their tasks efficiently through an intuitive interface. It demonstrates modern React development practices using **Hooks** for state management, **React Router** for navigation, and **Bootstrap** for responsive styling.

This project was created as part of the **Prelim Activity 2 for CCS112: Application Development and Emerging Technologies**.

## Project Scope

The goal is to build a task management system that leverages React's functional programming paradigm, modern state management techniques, and component-based architecture. The entire development process utilizes GitHub for version control and collaborative development, with clear branch management and merge workflows.

## Features

### Core Functionality
* **Create** new tasks with title and description.
* **Edit** existing task details.
* **Delete** completed or unwanted tasks.
* **Mark tasks** as complete/incomplete.
* **Filter** tasks by status (all, active, completed).
* **Search** tasks by keyword.

### User Interface
* Clean, intuitive navigation between different views.
* Real-time task updates without page refresh.
* Bootstrap-styled components for a consistent look and feel.

## Core Technical Requirements

| Requirement Area | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Functional Components** | All components must be built using **React Functional Components**. No Class Components are allowed. |
| **2. State Management** | Uses **`useState` Hook** for managing component and application state. Uses **`useEffect` Hook** for side effects and data persistence. All data must be managed through React Hooks. |
| **3. Routing** | Utilizes the **`react-router-dom`** library for navigation management. Includes multiple views/pages (Home, Task List, Task Details, About). Includes dynamic routing for individual task viewing. |
| **4. Styling** | Integration of **React-Bootstrap or standard Bootstrap CSS**. Fully responsive design using the Bootstrap grid system. Uses Bootstrap components for buttons, forms, cards, and navigation. |
| **5. GitHub Collaboration** | Shared GitHub repository for all team members. Enforces a **Feature branch workflow** (feature branches merge into main). Requires clear commit messages and Pull Request reviews. Uses clear branch naming conventions (e.g., `feature/add-task`, `feature/task-filters`). |
