# Responsive Layout Guidelines

To ensure optimal usability and experience across devices, the entire e-commerce platform is designed to be fully responsive. This means the layout, spacing, typography, and interaction patterns adapt fluidly from large desktop screens (‚â• 1024px) to small mobile devices (‚â§ 599px).

# Header and Navigation

* **Desktop Layout:**

Navigation links such as Home, Products, Categories, and Contact are laid out horizontally across the top navigation bar.
The search bar is centrally placed and fully expanded to promote easy access.
Cart and user icons are aligned to the far right and are always visible.
The entire header uses generous horizontal padding (‚â• 48px) to create visual separation and breathing room.

* **Mobile Layout:**

Navigation is hidden behind a hamburger menu (‚â°) to preserve space. This opens into a full-screen drawer.
The search input is replaced with a compact search icon (üîç) that expands or redirects to a search page when tapped.
Cart and user icons remain persistently visible on the top-right for accessibility.
Padding is reduced (‚â§ 16px) to maximize usable content space on smaller screens.

# Homepage Hero Section

* **Desktop:**

The hero area is split into two columns: the left side features a cozy, lifestyle image; the right side displays the text and primary CTA ("Shop Now").
Headline font is large (32px+) and centered within the overlay area.
CTA is proportionally sized and aligned for visibility.

* **Mobile:**

The hero content is stacked vertically. The image appears first, followed by the text and CTA.
The CTA spans nearly the full width to ensure it's easy to tap.
Headline font size is reduced (20‚Äì24px) to accommodate smaller screens without sacrificing impact.

# Product Listing Page (PLP)

* **Desktop:**

Layout consists of a persistent left sidebar for filters, while the right side displays a grid of product cards (typically 4 per row).
Filter and Sort By controls are visible and easily clickable.

* **Mobile:**

Filters are hidden behind a button that opens a modal (bottom sheet or full-screen).
Product grid adjusts to 2 products per row (or 1 for detail-focused layouts).
Filter and Sort buttons remain accessible above the product list.
This preserves a clutter-free browsing experience on small screens while keeping filters easily accessible when needed.

# Product Details Page (PDP)

* **Desktop:**

Layout is divided into two columns: product image gallery on the left, and product details on the right.
Action buttons like ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù and ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù are displayed side-by-side.

* **Mobile:**

Fully stacked layout where the image appears first, followed by product name, price, and buttons.
CTA buttons are full-width and stacked vertically with large tap targets.
Description, reviews, and specifications are placed in accordion-style collapsible panels to prevent long scrolls.

# Cart Page

* **Desktop:**

A two-column layout is used: cart items are listed on the left and the order summary appears on the right.
Items are shown in table format with product name, quantity, and price aligned in rows.

* **Mobile:**

Layout becomes vertical. Cart items are shown in card-style blocks with product details stacked.
The checkout button becomes sticky at the bottom of the screen to ensure visibility at all times.
This change improves checkout flow by keeping key actions within easy reach without excessive scrolling.

# Checkout Page

* **Desktop:**

Uses a side-by-side two-column layout. Left panel contains shipping and payment forms; right panel shows order summary.
Input fields like expiration date and CVV may be horizontally aligned to reduce form height.

* **Mobile:**

A fully stacked layout ensures vertical flow.
All form fields are full-width, with ample spacing for touch inputs.
Mobile-specific keyboard types are used (e.g., number pads for card numbers).
The ‚ÄúPay Now‚Äù button is full-width and remains visible at the bottom.
This responsive approach reduces user fatigue and simplifies the checkout process.
